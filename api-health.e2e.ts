// Note: This original file is assumed to be an E2E test suite using Playwright test framework.
// As jest is specified, here is a jest-compatible E2E test using supertest for example,
// but since no framework or server code is provided, only mocks are possible here to demonstrate jest E2E style.
// 
// However, for true E2E with original playwright test code should be run as as-is.
// Jest is to be used for unit/integration tests in the instructions.
//
// Since this is the original code for the API E2E tests using Playwright,
// no jest unit test is produced here, as it is an E2E test itself.
//
// If required, could be adapted with supertest + jest, but that requires express app or server.
// This file is provided as original E2E and not converted as Jest unit test.
//
// Thus, no jest test code is generated for this file.
